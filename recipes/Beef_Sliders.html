    <p>Beef sliders are a small version of a hamburger. A little trick helps you to get them all the same size so they cook evenly and look very professional. Do a couple of tests to determine your perfect degree of doneness and cook all the burgers the same amount of time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>16 paper muffin liners</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>8 slider-size burger buns, cut almost through horizontally</li>
        <li>8 slices roma (plum) tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground beef onto a work surface; divide into 8 equal-size pieces using a knife or pastry cutter. Line 8 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle bottoms of paper liners with salt and black pepper. Form each piece of burger into a rough ball and place into a muffin cup. Season tops with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a second paper liner on top of each piece of meat and gently press it down to shape the mini burger into a round, flat shape. Pull off the paper tops and remove burgers from the muffin cups; remove bottom paper liners from burgers.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook burgers in the hot skillet until they have a browned crust and are slightly pink in the middle, about 3 minutes per side. Flip burgers and cook 3 minutes on other side. Remove burgers to a plate to rest for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in a bowl; spoon a dollop onto each bun. Place burgers onto buns, season with more black pepper, and top with a tomato slice. Close buns and serve</li>
    </ol>
